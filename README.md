<h1>Tech Stack</h1>
I used MERN Stack for this website and cloudinary for storing profile pictures. I also used vite instead of CRA obviously because its a lot better.

<h1>Setup</h1>
Setup these enviroment variables, install the node modules and run the respective commands. Congratulations! You have your own version of wikicord running right on your computer! Make sure to change the BASE_URL variable with your api url in the api.js file so the frontend can communicate with the right backend.
